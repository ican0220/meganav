Meganav is a flexible, draggable link picker for constructing site navigation menus in Umbraco.

Click and drag an item to change it's position within the navigation; drop it wherever you choose. In the backoffice, the design of Meganav closely follows the other pickers in Umbraco to ensure your editor's experience is as familiar as possible.
